purchase this car. I had been waiting ,,
for several years for it to come out. I ,,
love everything about this car. People ,,
are always shouting out thier windows ,,
at me about how much they love it too! ,,
My daughter and her friends love to ,,

The handle to pull and latch the top is ,,
hard for a woman to use.,,
Likewise when the top is down the cover ,,
boot for the top is required to be in ,,
place and it too is difficult to latch.,,
The cover boot was replaced for a ,,
better fit but still suffers from ,,
difficulty to push the latches into the ,,
locking slots.,,
Dealer suggestion to place the boot ,,
cover on while heated up is a joke!,,

interior.  I've had my nbc close to 2 ,,
months and I love the car.  I know ,,
people complain that the 2.0 doesn't ,,
have enough power...it can be a little ,,
sluggish but nothing you can't deal ,,
with.  The turbo sure would be nice ,,
though.  Just wish I hadn't gotten ,,
black! Really hard to keep clean.  The ,,
bugs love this car too which is a ,,
pain.  Buying the car went smoothly.  ,,
The people at the dealership were ,,
great.  Overall a nice car...in my ,,
opinion.,,

engine makes a difference when compared ,,
to the normally aspirated engine. The 6-,,
speed tiptronic shifts imperceptively. ,,
The body is rigid with nary a cowl ,,
share or twisting. The 10 speaker ,,
monsoon powered system is strong. The ,,
backseats are narrow but still usable. ,,
The same goes for the trunk. It's such ,,
a wonderful care that you almost want ,,
to forget that it's too cute.,,

highway.  This car has plenty of zip to move ,,

not have it any other way.  It has been so ,,
much fun to drive!  The gas milage is great!,,

NC mountians.  The car handled almost ,,
as good as my A4 Audi Q.  Just think of ,,
it as a new bettle with the sound of an ,,
old one.  I took it up 15% grades with ,,
4 adults in 4 gear at 60mph with no ,,
problem.  Thats not bad. Car is solid ,,

one and you will agree.,,

months. The molding on the back window ,,
is falling off.,,
Volkswagen has spent massive amounts of ,,

broke the other window.  Brought it in ,,

difficult windshield frost in the ,,
extreme cold(minus zero temperatures.,,

was less than Civic EX / Corolla S (i ,,

to handle especially during curves / ,,
ramps (you can easily push the car to ,,
15 mph more than the specified speed at ,,

conclusion: Get the Jetta before the ,,

ONE technical problem: all 4 power ,,
windows started to fail in 01.,,
We were always impressed by the ,,
steering of the car in wet/snowy/icy ,,
conditions. We have driven it numerous ,,
times across the mountain passes in the ,,
winter and it has behaved admirably!,,
The manual transmission has proven to ,,
be extremely reliable and it has always ,,
helped us in controlling the vehicle ,,
and having more fun driving it.,,
This Jetta model has by far the largest ,,
trunk in its class.,,

replaced once. The molding was a ,,
problem until I found that epoxy and ,,
tape together holds longer. Pretty ,,
expensive to maintenance after warranty ,,
expired until I found a reasonable non-,,

a great car.  Im constantly getting ,,

3964,2003 Volkswagen Golf Diesel GL TDI 4dr Hatchback (1.9L 4cyl Turbodiesel 4A),
is a real winner. With an auto ,,
transmission I am getting 43 mpg. After ,,
maybe having bought 20 new cars over my ,,
life this is the first car that after ,,
three months has no long list of ,,
warranty repairs needed.Great fun to ,,
drive. Handling is more like a big ,,
heavy car. Since 1977 I have driven ,,
BMWs only. I will not miss them. I miss ,,
one thing: 6 way electric seats.,,

3967,2003 Volkswagen Golf Diesel GL TDI 4dr Hatchback (1.9L 4cyl Turbodiesel 5M),
noticed a fluid leaking from somewhere ,,
in the engine compartment.  I brought ,,
my brand new TDI with 500 miles in to ,,
be evaluated.  After 4 days I was told ,,
the transmission was destroyed by ,,
metal shards in the casing.  This was ,,
over 2 weeks ago.  Since then VW has ,,
tried many attempts to put me in a ,,
vehicle I don't want or did not ask ,,
for.  I traded in a BMW 3-series for ,,
this VW.  If I get my money back I ,,
know which dealership I will be ,,
visiting!,,

3969,2003 Volkswagen Golf Diesel GL TDI 4dr Hatchback (1.9L 4cyl Turbodiesel 5M),
yesterday morning. By 1pm i'm back with ,,
an electrical problem. When I touch the ,,
brakes the rear lights come on and so ,,
does my dash lights and the rear wiper. ,,
Turn signal has my dash flashing like a ,,
christmas tree and the rear wiper ,,
jerking across the rear window. It's ,,
really quite funny till you think about ,,
the fact you just dropped 25G's C$ for ,,
this thing.,,
 I really like the rest of the car. The ,,
fuel economy is amazing. The power up ,,
hills is great. The ride is a good ,,
blend of tight response and smooth feel.,,
 I'm sure the dealership will try to ,,
make things right. I have to wonder ,,
what will go next though.,,

the best I have owned. The TDI's low end,,

driving a six cylinder instead of a,,
four. Don't be afraid of the automatic.,,
I love it. I just hope this car is,,
reliable. I wish Toyota made a diesel,,
for U.S. consumption. If it stays,,
reliable this WILL be the best car I,,
ever owned. Just 3000 miles so far.,,

1996 Plymouth Neon due to mechanical ,,
problems thinking that I would not have ,,
the amount of problems with a new VW ,,
since we are previous owners of a 97 ,,
Golf K2.  First year had the car ,,
serviced 12 time and with 3 problems ,,
took it in 2x to fix.  Took the vehicle ,,
over to the BBB but VW did not want to ,,
buy it back.  Will not buy another VW.,,

of 1996 and it has been so reliable! I ,,
currently have 65k miles and NEVER had ,,
a problem with the vehicle. I've cared ,,

nothing beyond that. Its scrappy around ,,
town and handles like a true german ,,
car. No complaints (knock on wood). I ,,
highly suggest this car!,,

the time you lock it after returning ,,
EVERYTHING about this car makes the ,,
road a much more enjoyable place to be. ,,
The seats cradle you and hold you when ,,
the 1.8T engine forces G's at you. The ,,
Sleek design of the interior is just ,,
perfection. I really think this could ,,
contend for one of the best cars ,,
created. This car is a definate way to ,,
celebrate the 20th birthday of an ,,
amazing car.,,

ball to drive in any conditions. Power is great at ,,
stock levels[180} but chip it and now you can get ,,
real scary power in the low to mid range where it ,,
really shows it's muscles. Imola Yellow color gets ,,
the looks [Cops too!!] but what a cool ride.,,

It is solid sporty and fun. I chose ,,
this car over a nsx type s and celica ,,
gts. All have similar power but only ,,
one has german build quality and it's ,,
apparent as so as you drive it. I also ,,
like the 1.8t version which is faster ,,
than the VR6 according to Road & Track ,,
and other multiple sources. ,,

range should go out and test drive and ,,
feel the interior of the car. I was ,,
shopping around all dealers looking ,,
for a car 15-25k with a overall good ,,
package. It drives and feels like a ,,
audi (manual) and every detail in the ,,
car is high quality. I would ,,
definitely recommend this car over any ,,
car in this price range.,,

have had no major problems with the ,,
car. For 2002 there is a recall for ,,
wiring in the ABS system. What was ,,
scary is the window regulators. I had ,,
one glass fall into the door. I took it ,,
to the dealership and it was fixed with ,,
an updated kit free of charge and they ,,
went ahead and did it on the ,,
passenger's side. All that happened ,,
within the first 6 months of owning the ,,
car. I havent done anything to it ,,
since. The car is working great. Tires ,,
are stock michelin and are at half of ,,
their thread life. The only hard part ,,
about driving the car is keeping it ,,
under 60mph. ,,

the tires. When I first got the car I ,,
had just bought a Harley- Davidson ,,

not decide which one was more fun to ,,
drive.One year later I still can't ,,
decide. So if your looking for a car ,,
that you will have fun driving the GTI ,,

small sporty cars.  My car has been in ,,
the shop 12 TIMES for ignition coil ,,
problems and there has been little to ,,
no satisfaction from Corporate.  ,,
 This is my 4th VW and by far the one ,,
with the most problems.  The coils will ,,
have you in the shop every couple ,,
months and the service is terrible.,,

love the thing.  ,,
 I have a problem with the windows ,,
though.  First I had to get the window ,,
regulators replaced.  I guess plastic ,,
was used to build them the first time.  ,,
 NOW the sunroof is acting screwy.  I ,,
had to pop that little emergency panel ,,
and crank it two inches that it didn't ,,
cover on it;s own.  ,,
 Aggravating.  The rest of the car is ,,
sweet though.,,

I get. Great acceleration and handling. ,,
Extermely quiet interior too. This car ,,
drives and feels like it should cost ,,
alot more! The only problem I have had ,,
with this car is the power window ,,
mechinism in both windows have gone out ,,
twice. My dealer has handled this ,,
repair at no cost to me even with it ,,
being out of warranty.,,

error and was $900 to fix-  but it ,,

ripped. VW is supposed to help us out ,,
(there was a class action lawsuit) and ,,
the dealer is giving me a terrible time ,,
with this. So in the meantime the ,,
interior of my car is getting drenched ,,
each time it rains. The customer ,,
service all in all is horrendous. ,,
Not only did the top rip but other ,,
things are falling apart: the door ,,
slams shut on your leg. The indoor ,,
handle broke. The back seat is ripped ,,
at the seams and no one even rides back ,,
there. Cup holder broke. The outdoor ,,
handle is loose. This thing is one ,,
shoddy piece of work! I will NEVER buy ,,
another VW. ,,
5708,1998 Volkswagen Cabrio Convertible GL 2dr Convertible,
love the way it handles and all of the ,,
features that it has. I recommend this ,,
car to a someone that loves the freedom ,,
of a convertable! The best thing about ,,
this little car is that you can roll ,,
down the windows from the outside when ,,
you hold the key in the lock. This ,,
makes it great when you want to put the ,,
top down! ,,

more Eurovans.  As configured with the ,,
201 hp VR6 and the lower price it ,,
is less expensive and more usefully ,,

handle every need without having to ,,
endure a Econline-type full size van.,,
 As a 40 year old father of three I have ,,
to admit I get a kick out of the ,,
fact that the young VW crowd thinks my  ,,
family hauler is cool.  I've received ,,
accepting nods and other positive ,,
gestures from 20 year olds driving ,,
Golfs and Passats.  Not too many ,,
minivans owners can claim they get ,,
positive gestures from these younger ,,
drivers.,,

One of our board memebers owns a car ,,
dealership (not a VW dealership) and ,,
suggested that I take one for a test ,,
drive.  All I can tell you that this ,,
is the best car I've ever driven ,,
including the 2005 Audi.  It gives you ,,
a much needed back massage whenever ,,
you want one.  I have the upgraded ,,
sound system and it is heavenly as is ,,
the information system. The only ,,
drawback is the seats don't fully ,,
recline (so I cannot sleep in the ,,
car)!!!,,

 It has just the right amount of power and handling but is still smooth similar to a luxury car.  I am averaging around 29 mpg with mix city/hwy driving which is fantastic. ,,
 The car size is deceiving.  It looks relatively small but it is not.  We have been able to fill the car up a with a ton of gear and 4 adults and had no issues.  ,,
 The price for everything it offers is a steal.  I actually would have paid full sticker price and still been happy with it.  I would gladly purchase another one.  ,,

non-prestige name.  The interior is,,
gorgeous.  (A VW/Audi hallmark.)  The W8,,
engine is smooth and powerful.  The AWD,,
system is the best available: VW 4motion,,
 IS Audi quattro.  Tight precise,,
steering and a well-tuned (sport),,
suspension.  So sure-footed even in,,
blizzards that it exudes confidence. ,,
And it's a wagon -- so it has tons of,,
space.  A fully-loaded family truckster,,
shouldn't be able to blow the doors off,,
3-series and G35's; this one can.  But,,
what family truckster of old was this,,
polished?  It's like a buff gymnast in a,,
nice Italian suit.  Don't compare it,,
with other Passats; the luxuries it,,
offers are more in line with the,,
A6/allroad and 5-series.,,

was a compromise between me and my ,,
husband.  We previously owned an SUV ,,
which I hated from day one.  I wanted a ,,
comfortable sedan.  He thought we ,,
needed more space.  We were also in the ,,
market for a new car for him.  He got ,,
the sedan at the same time.  We love ,,
them both.  There are a couple of pet ,,
peeves I have about the vehicle - the ,,
blinker doesn't shut off until the ,,
steering wheel is almost in a straigt ,,
position and I find the windshield ,,
wiper controls hard to maneuver - but ,,
minor details compared to everything ,,
else.  The back seat is also a bit ,,
tight with two car seats back there.  ,,
7409,2003 Volkswagen Passat Wagon GL Fwd 4dr Wagon (1.8L 4cyl Turbo 5M),
Build quality and dealer service have ,,
been poor. Paint had numerous small ,,
blems.  Rear hatch trim replaced ,,
twice. Roof line trim inserts bow up.  ,,
Fully loaded highway ride not ,,
comfortable. 1.8T slow off the line - ,,
OK at speed. Fuel economy not great.,,
Tip: on your test drive set tire ,,
pressure ,,
to mfg spec - this dealer sets them ,,
low to smooth out ride.,,

 We (4 of us) drove this car from ,,
Dallas to Toronto and it performed ,,
flawlessly. Very smooth and ,,
comfortable. I drove 8 hours per day ,,
but did not feel tired at the end of ,,
the day. I was amazed at what we ,,

still could use the privacy screen.,,

have ever owned! I will never buy ,,
another VW based on the experience I ,,
have had with thier service departments ,,
and the quality of thier product. I ,,
have dumped more money into this car ,,
just to keep it on the road. On top of ,,
that many of the repairs are things I ,,
have never seen go bad on any other ,,
vehicle and they reoccur. Buying this ,,
car is the worst mistake I have ever ,,
made!! Do not follow suit...,,

8831,1999 Volkswagen Passat Wagon GLS 1.8T Turbo 4dr Wagon,
interior.  The oil leaking ,,
underpowered 1.8T is the weak point.  ,,
I've known the original owner since ,,
she purchased it brand new.  She took ,,
excellent care of it and kept up on ,,
regular services yet at 60000 miles it ,,
is leaking oil like the exxon valdez ,,
from almost every gasket and seal.  I ,,
would expect better from a company ,,
like VW/Audi.,,

8834,1999 Volkswagen Passat Wagon GLS 1.8T Turbo 4dr Wagon,
Hesitation has been with us from the ,,
start.  Techs just say to live with it ,,
and it is in the software.,,
 Multiple oil leaks.  3 times.,,
 Intake boot came off and shut the car ,,
down.  ,,
 The throttle sticks.  Car was in twice ,,
for repairs.,,
 The rear brakes jammed.,,
 The spark plug module failed causing ,,
the car to run on 3 cylinders.  ,,
Cost was $536 to replace and is not ,,
covered on the powertrain warrenty.  ,,
The car is only 3 ,,
years old (purchased new in 2000) and ,,
has only 61K miles on it.,,
 Cruise control works when it feels like ,,
it.  There are other issues that I am ,,
forgetting.,,

Today this car reached 300k miles and it still runs like new.  No lights on dash and still great gas mileage. ,,
Will never get rid of it until the tires fall of it. ,,
German cars are great cars for those who know how to take care of em. They're not for everyone and u cant go to auto zone and buy parts for it and expect it to last. U get what u pay for. I have never been stuck with it and I don't think I ever will. Safe and reliable and good looking car.,,
